# Mental Health Prediction

This repository contains a Streamlit-based application for **mental health risk prediction** and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The app is built to process datasets related to mental health factors, perform data preprocessing, and provide interactive visualizations.

## Features

- Upload datasets for analysis.
- Handle missing values intelligently based on user type (student/working professional).
- Process `Sleep Duration` data to handle ranges and approximate values.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with:
  - Categorical feature distributions.
  - Numerical feature distributions.
  - Correlation matrix.
  - Relationships between features and the target variable (`Depression`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AUGUSTINGEORGE/Mental-Health-Prediction.git
   cd Mental-Health-Prediction
